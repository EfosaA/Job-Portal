# Directions for cloning the repository:
This is a very important step. In order for the website to be hosted on your machine, you must clone the repository on your machine to the xampp/htdocs folder. If you do not clone it to this folder, you will be unable to locally host the website on your machine. It is imperative that you do not skip this step. 


# Directions getting the server running:
To get the server up and running, click on the XAMPP control panel application and then click start for both Apache and MySQL to be running on your machine. Next, go to google chrome and type in: “localhost/phpmyadmin” in order to view the database. Click on another tab, and type in 

localhost/Job-Portal/TheCarrieraProject/index.html

in order to view the index page. Once this is done, you will be able to navigate through the pages as well input data that will get saved into the MySQL database.
